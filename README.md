# Little-Lemon-analysis-and-sales-report

# Project Description

The Little Lemon Analysis and Sales Report project is a comprehensive data engineering and analysis solution designed to optimize restaurant operations and improve decision-making. This system leverages database stored procedures and robust querying techniques to extract actionable insights from operational data.

The project focuses on:

Identifying peak booking hours to optimize staffing and resource allocation.

Analyzing guest status to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.

Ensuring database integrity and synchronization during complex operations.

This project demonstrates the application of meta database engineering principles such as:

Database Procedural Automation: Using stored procedures to encapsulate complex business logic.

Efficient Query Handling: Avoiding command synchronization errors using methods like cursor.nextset() to process multiple result sets seamlessly.

Scalable Design: Ensuring database queries and structures are optimized for growth.

# Features

Peak Booking Hour Analysis

Extracts the busiest booking hours to aid in resource management.

Implements CALL PeakHours() stored procedure for automated analysis.

Guest Status Analysis

Retrieves and categorizes guest information for personalized experiences.

Utilizes CALL GuestStatus() stored procedure to process guest data.

Synchronization and Error Handling

Ensures smooth processing of multiple result sets using cursor.nextset().

Incorporates exception handling for robust database operations.

Meta Database Engineering Practices

Demonstrates principles of database procedural abstraction and efficient cursor management.

Highlights techniques for error-free execution of stored procedures.

# Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Database: MySQL

Key Libraries:

mysql.connector for database connectivity and operations
dotenv for environment variable management

# Setup and Usage

Prerequisites

Install Python (version 3.8 or higher).

Set up a MySQL with user credentials and add them to .env.

Run the script:

python main.py

# Meta Database Engineering Concepts

This project integrates advanced database engineering practices:

Encapsulation of Logic: Business logic is encapsulated in stored procedures for modularity and maintainability.

Multiple Result Set Handling: Leverages cursor.nextset() to handle multi-step queries in stored procedures.

Data Synchronization: Prevents out-of-sync errors by explicitly closing result sets before executing new ones.

Error Handling: Ensures robust operations with comprehensive exception handling.
